* Corporation ABC are using SQL Server as their ERP backend. 
* Finance has reported that Corporation ABC is migrating to BANK Ltd in the coming months. 
* HR has engaged with BANK Ltd in the meantime regarding the monthly salary payments. 
* They are concerned how the payment files will be send to the bank and ultimately be processed by the 24th of each month. 
* BANK Ltd has informed HR that they a have a portal by which salary files can be uploaded for processing on a monthly bases.

John, BA for Corporate ABC, has done the necessary analysis and has dotted the following Use Case:

* On the 24th of each month, a payment file (csv format), must be exported with employee salary information from the ERP database to a locked down shared HR folder. The file will be accessible by a HR employee whom will upload the payment file via the bank’s portal. 

You have been task to design and developed the solution by extracting the data out of the ERP into shared folder. You need to provide the following:

* Solution & Technical Design artifacts
* Identify any possible RISK in a matrix format
* Developed a small export application. Please showcase how you would architect your solution even though it would be an overkill for such a simple solution. I’m looking for patterns and best practices knowledge. (Only if you have time)
